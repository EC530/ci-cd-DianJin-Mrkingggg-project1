## Project 1 components:

1. Add matrice multiplication function and in proj1.py
   
2. Add unit tests for matrice multiplication in test_proj1.py

3. Add memory usage test using tracemalloc for all tests.
   
4. Add logging in each function with start level: INFO. Logging could report normal information and exception occurance using different logging level:
   info and exception( error )

5. Add CPU time test in conftest.py so that cpu run time: ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall could be observed.

6. Include coverage and flake configurations in py-ci.yml of .github/workflow and pass the Github Actions' build.

### Using pytest -s test_proj1.py to show complete information.
